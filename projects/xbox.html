                    <p class="p__projects invert">
                    The app re-design was planned as a self-study project in order to familiarize myself with 
                    re-design's process. Also, I wanted to challenge myself with a bigger project and one that required 
                    me from planning on something that already existed, understanding its flaws and adding value to it.
                    <br>
                    The main problem with the app seems to be that it finds itself in a beta phase, and thus
                    most things are still vaguely designed.
                    <br>
                    It took me about two weeks to complete it.

                    The app (to date, July 2021) has many failures, as <strong>many of the copies are misleading</strong>,
                    the social engagement system is really <strong>weak and tricky</strong>, you almost never know where in the app you are and
                    the settings tab is very <strong>misleading</strong>.
                    <br>
                    While navigating the app and understanding each section, I believed that I could design a better flow 
                    and feel for it, and here I will portray the final result of it. Again, my main objective was to 
                    <strong>add more value for the user</strong> to use the app, and for it to have a <strong>clearer structure</strong>.

                <p class="p__projects">
                    Since this was supposed to be a re-organization of the app, the most important thing was to
                    understand the actual architecture of the app and rearranging it so that it gives the user more value.
                    <br>
                    That is why I studied where did the app failed and after taking some notes on what could be viable, 
                    I created a new Information Architecture scheme and started doing the wireframes (which are shown below).

                <h3>"Recommend me" Function</h3>  
                <p class="p__projects">
                    While planning on what could be improved in the app, I've realised that the Recommendation tool didn't work as desireable, only showing 
                    a random game for the user to pick, which lead me to think about a new system.
                    <br>
                    As shown below, the current tool only displays a random game, which might <strong>not fit what the player is looking for</strong>, ignoring its preferences.
                </p>    
                <img class="img__projects__xb" src="../assets/imgs/xbox/xbox_recommendold.gif" alt="XBOX App Recommend Old Tool"/>

                <p class="p__projects">
                    Therefore I thought of creating a new randomizer, based on the <strong>Gamer Motivation model</strong> (more info about it <a href="https://quanticfoundry.com/gamer-motivation-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>).
                    The Gamer Motivation model will work as to categorize the steps that the user has to go through in order for the app to recommend one game.
                    <br>
                    As shown below, the steps are the next ones: 
                    <br><br>
                    1. to pick a <em>category</em> for the game, depending on the user's mood;
                    <br>
                    2. to pick a <em>epoque</em> for the game, depending on when it was released;
                    <br>
                    3. to pick a <em>duration</em> for the game, depending on how much time the user wants to invest on it.

                <h3>Game Pass Section Re-design</h3>  
                <p class="p__projects">
                    The Game Pass section can be though as the core of the app, that is why some changes
                    needed to be done in order to follow the planned objectives. Although I will be explaining the improvements 
                    with its images, the project is better understood when navigating the prototype.
                    <br>

                    Since the app should revolve around the idea of the player's preference <strong>to keep an engagement</strong>,
                    putting something first for the player to enjoy is a must. That is why, the highlights for the games
                    in a header remain the same, but the first thing that the player will encounter while scrolling is
                    a "You might like" section together with the recommendation tool. (Before this, the user would find first
                    the "Recently added" category, which can be placed down below).
                </p>
                    <img class="img__projects__xb" src="../assets/imgs/xbox/xbox_gamepass1.png" alt="XBOX App Game Pass change"/>

                <p class="p__projects">

                    Also, categories/genres for the games are displayed earlier (as opposed to the normal app where they are at the bottom),
                    so that the user can <strong>easily access and understand</strong> how games are displayed. After this, different carrousels with 
                    selected games are displayed (as in the real app).
                </p>
                
                <img class="img__projects__xb" src="../assets/imgs/xbox/xbox_gamepass2.png" alt="XBOX App Game Pass change"/>

                <p class="p__projects">
                    As in the app per se, menu tabs have been added so that they displayed when the user hovers over the different app categories,
                    making it easier to <strong>access things faster</strong>. Also, the sections have been rearranged, so the Game Pass and Store 
                    (which contain the games) are first, and the Social section is relegated to a third position, so there is <strong>more congruence in
                    between tabs</strong>.
                </p>     

                <img class="img__projects__xb" src="../assets/imgs/xbox/xbox_tabs.gif" alt="XBOX App Game Pass change"/>

                <p class="p__projects">
                    Lastly, the games' card is <strong>better organised</strong>, displaying fewer information on the Home screen, but amplified when
                    clicking on the "See all" button, where all information will be displayed. 
                    <br>

                <p class="p__projects">
                    The Store section was designed as to be a mirror to the Game Pass section with a few changes.
                    As it feels really empty and soulless on the original design, I believe that doing some minimal
                    changes to it might increase its value and overall look.
                    <br>
                    These changes would include a more social engagement in which a <strong>Wishlist</strong> on 
                    the main page is displayed.

                    Also, to add a more touch and value to the social part of the app, the games that your friends
                    have liked and are playing are also displayed on the main page of the store, which doesn't happen
                    in the original app.

                <h3>Social Section Re-design</h3>  
                <p class="p__projects">
                    Regarding the Social section, the actual one <strong>lacks a simple layout</strong>, making it difficult to understand
                    the main flow and many of the actions that can be done.
                    Some of the main reasons for a social section is to see what your friends are playing and to chat with them,
                    and this was lacking in the old one, as it was very difficult to start a conversation or even befriend someone.
                    <br>
                    In the proposed design, the Social section is made of two tabs: one for <strong>friends</strong> and one for <strong>messages</strong> (both are
                    connected). For instance, in the friends section you'll find games that your friends are playing and they've enjoyed.
                    Also, there is a function were you'll be able to <strong>link other accounts</strong> in order to engage more with the Microsoft platform.
                    <br>
                    The friends with whom you interact the most will appear first, and from there you'll be able to send them a message. 
                </p>

                    <img class="img__projects__xb" src="../assets/imgs/xbox/xbox_social1.png" alt="XBOX App Social change"/>

                <p class="p__projects">
                    On the other hand, the message section ressembles more of an average message app, where you have a sidebar with your

                <p class="p__projects">
                    The changes in the profile were made to portray a clearer UI and eliminate the message section. 
                    In this new profile design, you can quickly change or edit your profile and access the settings of the app.
                    Also, more data from the player is showed, which will help create a bigger audience since there is more
                    social value to it.

                    <strong>1.</strong> Overall, the main problem with the user flows was that
                    they were not obvious and most times the user could get lost in between levels.</p>

                    <strong>2.</strong> The "Recommend Me" tool was not very efficient as it didn't have basis
