                                The app re-design was planned as a self-study project in order to familiarize myself with 
                                re-design's process. Also, I wanted to challenge myself with a bigger project and one that required 
                                me from planning on something that already existed, understanding its flaws and adding value to it.
                                <br>
                                The main problem with the app seems to be that it finds itself in a beta phase, and thus
                                most things are still vaguely designed.
                                <br>
                                It took me about two weeks to complete it.

                <p class="p__projects">
                    The app (to date, July 2021) has many failures, as <strong>many of the copies are misleading</strong>,
                    the social engagement system is really <strong>weak and tricky</strong>, you almost never know where in the app you are and
                    the settings tab is very <strong>misleading</strong>.
                    <br>
                    While navigating the app and understanding each section, I believed that I could design a better flow 
                    and feel for it, and here I will portray the final result of it. Again, my main objective was to 
                    <strong>add more value for the user</strong> to use the app, and for it to have a <strong>clearer structure</strong>.

                <p class="p__projects">
                    Since this was supposed to be a re-organization of the app, the most important thing was to
                    understand the actual architecture of the app and rearranging it so that it gives the user more value.
                    <br>
                    That is why I studied where did the app failed and after taking some notes on what could be viable, 
                    I created a new Information Architecture scheme and started doing the wireframes (which are shown below).

                <h3>"Recommend me" Function</h3>  
                <p class="p__projects">
                    While planning on what could be improved in the app, I've realised that the Recommendation tool didn't work as desireable, only showing 
                    a random game for the user to pick, which lead me to think about a new system.
                    <br>
                    As shown below, the current tool only displays a random game, which might <strong>not fit what the player is looking for</strong>, ignoring its preferences.
                </p>    
                <img class="img__projects__st" src="../assets/imgs/xbox/xbox_recommendold.gif" alt="XBOX App Recommend Old Tool"/>

                <p class="p__projects">
                    Therefore I thought of creating a new randomizer, based on the <strong>Gamer Motivation model</strong> (more info about it <a href="https://quanticfoundry.com/gamer-motivation-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>).
                    The Gamer Motivation model will work as to categorize the steps that the user has to go through in order for the app to recommend one game.
                    <br>
                    As shown below, the steps are the next ones: 
                    <br><br>
                    1. to pick a <em>category</em> for the game, depending on the user's mood;
                    <br>
                    2. to pick a <em>epoque</em> for the game, depending on when it was released;
                    <br>
                    3. to pick a <em>duration</em> for the game, depending on how much time the user wants to invest on it.

                <h3>Game Pass Section Re-design</h3>  
                <p class="p__projects">
                    The Game Pass section can be though as the core of the app, that is why some changes
                    needed to be done in order to follow the planned objectives. Although I will be explaining the improvements 
                    with its images, the project is better understood when navigating the prototype.
                    <br>
                    -<br>
                    Since the app should revolve around the idea of the player's preference <strong>to keep an engagement</strong>,
                    putting something first for the player to enjoy is a must. That is why, the highlights for the games
                    in a header remain the same, but the first thing that the player will encounter while scrolling is
                    a "You might like" section together with the recommendation tool. (Before this, the user would find first
                    the "Recently added" category, which can be placed down below).

                    <img class="img__projects__st" src="../assets/imgs/xbox/xbox_gamepass1.png" alt="XBOX App Game Pass change"/>

                    <br>
                    -<br>

                    Also, categories/genres for the games are displayed earlier (as opposed to the normal app where they are at the bottom),
                    so that the user can <strong>easily access and understand</strong> how games are displayed. After this, different carrousels with 
                    selected games are displayed (as in the real app).

                    <img class="img__projects__st" src="../assets/imgs/xbox/xbox_gamepass2.png" alt="XBOX App Game Pass change"/>

                    <br>
                    -<br>
                    
                    As in the app per se, menu tabs have been added so that they displayed when the user hovers over the different app categories,
                    making it easier to <strong>access things faster</strong>.

                    <img class="img__projects__st" src="../assets/imgs/xbox/xbox_gamepass2.png" alt="XBOX App Game Pass change"/>

                    Lastly, the games' card is <strong>better organised</strong>, displaying fewer information on the Home screen, but amplified when
                    clicking on the "See all" button, where all information will be displayed. 
                    <br>
                    (When in the prototype, click on the Doom eternal game to see an example).

                    <strong>1.</strong> Overall, the main problem with the user flows was that
                    they were not obvious and most times the user could get lost in between levels.</p>

                    <strong>2.</strong> The "Recommend Me" tool was not very efficient as it didn't have basis
                    on why it showcased a specific game instead of another.</p>
