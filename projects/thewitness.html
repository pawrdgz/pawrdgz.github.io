                    “<em>There's not anything random, when you see something in a certain place, it feels intentional, a

                    to be logged into a solved puzzle in order to kindle. The game has no correct path, but these tubes will <strong>subliminally guide 
                    the player</strong> in case we do not know where to go.</p>

                    The mechanic for the game is simple: to <strong>solve puzzles by linking a 
                    starting point with an ending one</strong> in a panel, altogether with a try&error system. 
                    The mechanic is found in different sets of panels that are positioned all along the island, 
                    each set (of panels) having a different rule (or pattern) to complete.</p>

                    These rules (or patterns) are well constructed as they first show you how to complete them with a simple grid/puzzle,

                    as some puzzles also require the player to focus on the environment, as shown in the image.</p>

                    <strong>1.</strong> The onboarding for this game is rather peculiar but effective, 
                    as it showcases the language in which the whole game is written: solve puzzles.</p>

                <p class="p__projects">
                    <strong>2.</strong> The learning curve is well balanced, as the difficulty gradually
                    increases in each set of puzzles, but never overwhelms the player with unknown challenges.</p>

                    <strong>3.</strong> The game follows the principle “Form follows function”,
