                            In this, we had to prove all we have learnt, and since it was also a group project, we also learnt
                            to work in a team.
                            The theme that we were given and the one that we had to work on was "Health during COVID-19".

                <p class="p__projects">
                    Through the whole project we used the Double Diamond Methodology in order to proceed step by step.
                    The idea was to have a human centric design that covers a real need, and that is why we decided to work
                    following the double diamond structure, as it helped us identify real value for our hypothetical users.
                    <br>
                    Following this scheme, I'll try to explain (step by step), the parts that I consider were crucial in our development of the app.

                <h3>Context and Discovery</h3>  
                <p class="p__projects">
                    As previously said, we had the thematic area for the app but not the idea, so the first thing that we had to do was
                    to analyze and <strong>find a real need</strong> in the area of "Health in COVID-19".
                    So the first steps was to understand what we were facing, and that involved <strong>a media analysis</strong>, 
                    defining our <strong>archtypes</strong> (for later on working on our protopersonas and User Personas) and running 
                    some <strong>surveys</strong> (aimed to understand the general state of people's physical and mental status, 
                    for which we received more than 130 answers).
                </p>    
                <img class="img__projects__st" src="../assets/imgs/mypersona/mypersona_contexto.png" alt="MyPersona Context"/>

                <p class="p__projects">
                    With these results, we could filter many <strong>thematic areas</strong> and information that would be useful in the <strong>interviews</strong> that we conducted.
                    The interviewed were carefully selected as we needed them to fit our protopersonas, so that we could better understand what was lacking
                    in the Health area regarding COVID-19.
                    <br>
                    With our interview results and after classifing the information, we could extract <strong>patterns</strong> that would be used in order to create our User Personas
                    and extract <strong>Insights</strong> (which we would later on translate into Opportunities).

                    In these, we collected and organized all the information that we previously had to create our <strong>User Persona</strong>
                    and project a <strong>Customer Journey Map</strong>, which would help us spot the pain points and frictions that the user faces in certain
                    occasions, altogether with the general experience of the user.

                    In this part, I should higlight the Insights and Opportunities that we extracted and later on used to find ideas for the app.
                    The final idea for the app was selected after using a <strong>prioritization matriz</strong> in order to understand which one would have <strong>more value</strong>
                    for the user and a <strong>better distinction in the market</strong>. 
                    <br> 
                    Once we had the idea, we conducted an <strong>Inception</strong> to align the team's thoughts and work.

                    to organize our workload. We worked in 4 sprints, each sprint being a whole month.
                    Once we had these, our process was a constant state of Prototyping - Testing - Iterating.

                    This project was my first approach to a real project in real life, and although I have not shown in here
                    all the steps that we have gone through, I feel happy about the result and feel completely prepared to keep 
                    working on it as I am doing at the moment.
                    <br>
                    Right now, my main focus is to keep working on it as I believe it has many potential and I could be learning
                    even more, doing more User Tests and keeping on iterating.
